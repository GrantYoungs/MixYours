# MixYours
A website for cocktail/mixer recipe creation and sharing.

This is the source code for a website idea that I had. MixYours is a website where you can find, create, and share new cocktail recipes.
If you're looking for a new drink to mix up for your upcoming party, this is the perfect site for you.

So far the current link to the website is http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~youngsgr/mixyours/
It's a work in progress so far.
